# FurTogether

This project is targetted to allow dog owners to connect with one another and find paw friends for their dogs to have fun with.
Users can create persona user profiles for themselves and their paw buddies as well as their walking routines.
Users are able to look for dogs walking within the search vinicity and their time of walk. Users are also able to view the routines of other users in order to meet up or indicate their own walking time and location for the day.
